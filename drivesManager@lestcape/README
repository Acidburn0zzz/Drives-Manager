How to add a new language:

1-Open terminal and write "locale", the output is some things like this:
LANG=es_MX.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=es_MX:es
LC_CTYPE="es_MX.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="es_MX.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="es_MX.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE="es_MX.UTF-8"
LC_MONETARY="es_MX.UTF-8"
LC_MESSAGES="es_MX.UTF-8"
LC_PAPER="es_MX.UTF-8"
LC_NAME="es_MX.UTF-8"
LC_ADDRESS="es_MX.UTF-8"
LC_TELEPHONE="es_MX.UTF-8"
LC_MEASUREMENT="es_MX.UTF-8"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="es_MX.UTF-8"
LC_ALL=

In this example the first row "LANG=es_MX.UTF-8" is mark that  system language it's in spanish. Look "es" it's the key to determine the language.
2-Go to /home/User/.local/share/cinnamon/desklets/drivesManager@lestcape
3-In the lang folder make a copy of file "en" and change the name of file copy to the key name was obtained in step 1.
4-Open the copy of file, in the contents of this, exist some lines with a "key=value" format. You can't change the key. You can only change the value, translate the present value in english language to your language.
5-Save your file.
6-Close the desklet and the system settings, if it's open.
7-Delete the file settings-schema.json in folder  /home/User/.local/share/cinnamon/desklets/drivesManager@lestcape. Please take warning, don't delete the file skeleton-settings-schema.json or some another one.
8-Open the desklet, it's now in your language.
9-Please send your file by email lestcape@gmail.com. It's will be putting in the official web page of cinnamon, with your nick name or name depending on your preference.

Warning! Cinnamon has a bug in the handling of special characters, such as accents or ñ. This is only for users who do not use the english language. All translation files need to be in UTF-8 encoding. Different encodings to UTF-8 are not admitted, even are compatible with UTF-8. You can help that the problem is quickly solved, participating in the discussion of the following url: https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/2245

Issues and improvements:

- Warning! This desklet need gksu package is installed to activate advanced options.The pkexec package cannot be added at this time.
- hddtemp is too slow to run it directly on the console. This is why it generates a temporary file called datahddtemp, with the output of this command, which will be read when needed.
- Iconv command is needed in order to automatically update the translation file when this has special characters. View: https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/2245
- Advanced Option for Optical devices, need packages "cdrecord" and "wodim" to detect status(open/closed) of the CD/DVD. The command cdrecord depends on wodim, and when the optical drive has a disk, wodim sometimes fail to properly access the device.
- Optical option, only detect as a CD/DVD drives, the device id match with "dev/sr[0-9]+", "/dev/cdrom[0-9]+", "/dev/cdrom", "/dev/scd[0-9]+", "/dev/hdc". If you have other id for some optical device, please let me know, to update.
- The Hard drive and optical option need the "coreutils" package, for use the command df.
- Sometimes auto mount points open devices may fail and open more than once the same volume. This is because the volume was removed using an alternative mode not recognized by the operating system, and when this reconnect may appear doubled.
- The "use pmount package" option requires package "pmount". The pmount command does not need superuser permissions to process the operation mount and unmount, which is why the operation can not be performed with protocols support operating system. Visit: http://pmount.alioth.debian.org/, for more details on this package.
