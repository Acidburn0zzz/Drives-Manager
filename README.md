Known bugs and requirements:

1- Warning! To use this desklet needs you have installed the following programs:
   - gksu, kdesu or pkexec.
   - cdrecord
   - eject
   - A plain text editor either.
   - hddtemp (optional).

2- The data of hddtemp not was obtained directly in the Cinnamon thread processing, because it blocked by a few milliseconds the desktop. A new theme is launched to perform this task, outside the context of the implementation of cinnamon, only if this option is required and for the time being.

3- Only we can detect optical disks a CD/DVD, if to devices are recognized by the Linux kernel matching with the regular expresions "dev/sr[0-9] +",  "/dev/cdrom[0-9]+", "/dev/cdrom", "/dev/scd[0-9]+" and "/dev/hdc". If you have a handle to a different optical device, please report it on the website of this program, and this will be included in the next version.

4- The option of auto-open mount points can give many problems, it's because the known incompatibility between Nautilus and Nemo. Any incident, please report it on the website of this desklet.

5- Be careful! When a removable device has more than one partition and is active the option to reconnect the device, this without removing them from the connector. It can be happen that in a negligence, you unplugged a device that have some partitions mounted yet and therefore you can lose some importan data.
